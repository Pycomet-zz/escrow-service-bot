<!-- PROBLEM SOLVED -->
## Problem Solved

In the world we live in now, business is mostly done on the internet and customers are more unwilling to buy products from sellers they do not trust or have no personal reference to. Knowing they could be mislead or scammed of their money with no trace for refunds.

This is a growing problem and my [Escrow Service Bot](https://github.com/Pycomet/escrow-service-bot) is aimed at eradicating the problem, thereby giving large trade group owners and sellers more business. And, also giving buyers the confidence to purchase goods without risk involved.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The Escrow Service Bot offers an automated service acting as an escrow platform, able to facilitate a completely save trade environment on which both the seller and buyer can thrive and do business happily.

All payments are being made directly to the respective parties, either through Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripplecoin or Bitcoin Cash cryptocurrency which ofcourse is predefined by the seller's choice of local currency from the following:

- US Dollars (USD)
- Euros (EUR)
- British Pound (GBP)
- Canadian Dollar (CAD)
- Japanese Yen (JPY)
- The Swiss Franc (CHF)

With an affiliate program being part of the structure, administrators of different Telegram Group platforms are also able to use the [Escrow Service Bot](https://github.com/Pycomet/escrow-service-bot) in conducting save and fast business transactions within their groups smoothly, with each transaction being completed secured and easily traceable. Also, each registered group admin is entitled to a charge on every trade carried out by the group members.
